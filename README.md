# companion-device-framework

Welcome to the Companion Device Framework Github Repostiory. 

Introduction
------------
This repo hosts Windows UWP sample code to illustrate the use of Companion Device Framework (CDF), a new feature in Windows 10, enabling developers to build UWP apps to unlock Windows 10 PCs. A companion device is a device that can act in conjunction with your Windows 10 desktop to enhance the user authentication experience. Using the Companion Device Framework, a companion device can provide a rich experience for Microsoft Passport even when Windows Hello is not available (e.g., if the Windows 10 desktop lacks a camera for face authentication or fingerprint reader device, for example).

More details on the CDF is available here - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/companion-device-unlock

Feedback on the Code Samples
----------------------------
If you have any feedback or questions on the code samples, please feel free to mail Companion Device Framework Onboarding <CDFOnboard@microsoft.com>.

Requesting capabilities for Store Submissions for your CDF UWP App
------------------------------------------------------------------
You are free to use the code sample to create your own CDF UWP app to unlock Windows PCs.  To submit your app to the Store, you would need permissions to use the secondaryAuthenticationFactor restricted capability.    For the same, please mail Companion Device Framework Onboarding <CDFOnboard@microsoft.com>.
